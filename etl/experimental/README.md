# Experimental - Early-Stage ETL Approaches

This directory contains experimental ETL pipeline approaches that are in early development, testing, or proof-of-concept stages.

## Contents

- **Proof-of-concept implementations** for new ideas
- **Early-stage development** that needs validation
- **Performance experiments** testing new approaches
- **Research prototypes** exploring different methodologies

## Guidelines

- **DO** experiment freely with new approaches
- **DO** document findings and lessons learned
- **DO** use clear naming conventions
- **DO NOT** use in production without validation
- **DO** move to `stable/` when ready

## Development Process

1. **Create** new experimental approach
2. **Document** the hypothesis and approach
3. **Test** with small datasets
4. **Benchmark** performance characteristics
5. **Validate** accuracy against known results
6. **Promote** to `stable/` when ready

## Naming Convention

Use descriptive names that indicate the approach:
- `reflection-metadata/` - C# reflection-based extraction
- `adaptive-sampling/` - Adaptive resolution sampling
- `hybrid-validation/` - Combined approach validation
