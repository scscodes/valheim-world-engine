# Backend Restart Required - Additional Biome Fix

## Issue Found
The `world_loader.py` service had a **hardcoded biome mapping** with the same incorrect IDs that was causing "Unknown_512" instead of "Ashlands".

## Root Cause
Two separate places had incorrect biome ID mappings:
1. ✅ `models/world_data.py` - Biome enum (fixed earlier)
2. ❌ `services/world_loader.py` - Hardcoded dictionary in `_get_biome_name()` (just fixed)

## What Was Fixed

### Before (world_loader.py lines 211-222):
```python
biome_names = {
    0: "None",
    1: "Meadows",
    2: "Swamp",        # ✗ Should be 4
    4: "Mountain",     # ✗ Should be 8
    8: "BlackForest",  # ✗ Should be 2
    16: "Plains",      # ✓ Correct
    32: "Ocean",       # ✓ Correct
    64: "Mistlands",   # ✓ Correct
    128: "Ashlands",   # ✗ Should be 512
    256: "DeepNorth"   # ✓ Correct
}
```

### After:
```python
# Now uses the canonical Biome enum from models
from app.models.world_data import Biome

biome_names = {
    Biome.NONE: "None",              # 0
    Biome.MEADOWS: "Meadows",        # 1
    Biome.BLACK_FOREST: "BlackForest", # 2 ✓
    Biome.SWAMP: "Swamp",            # 4 ✓
    Biome.MOUNTAIN: "Mountain",      # 8 ✓
    Biome.PLAINS: "Plains",          # 16
    Biome.OCEAN: "Ocean",            # 32
    Biome.MISTLANDS: "Mistlands",    # 64
    Biome.DEEP_NORTH: "DeepNorth",   # 256
    Biome.ASHLANDS: "Ashlands"       # 512 ✓
}
```

## Benefits of This Fix
1. **Single Source of Truth**: Uses `Biome` enum from models instead of hardcoded values
2. **DRY Principle**: Eliminates duplicate biome ID definitions
3. **Type Safety**: Enum values are compile-time checked
4. **Maintainability**: Future biome additions only need to update the enum

## Action Required

**Restart the backend** to load the updated code:

```bash
# Stop the current backend (Ctrl+C in the terminal running uvicorn)

# Then restart:
cd /home/steve/projects/valhem-world-engine/etl/experimental/adaptive-sampling-client
source venv/bin/activate
cd backend/VWE_WorldDataAPI
uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```

## Expected Result After Restart

**API Response (`/api/v1/worlds/hkLycKKCMI/biomes?format=json`):**
```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "sample_spacing_meters": 78.125,
    "biome_counts": {
      "Ocean": 11904,
      "DeepNorth": 20792,
      "BlackForest": 6814,
      "Ashlands": 9716,      ← Changed from "Unknown_512"
      "Mountain": 1770,
      "Mistlands": 3567,
      "Plains": 7445,
      "Swamp": 1484,
      "Meadows": 2044
    },
    "generation_time": null
  }
}
```

## Verification Steps
1. ✅ Restart backend
2. ✅ Refresh frontend (hard reload: Ctrl+Shift+R)
3. ✅ Check legend shows "Ashlands: 14.8%"
4. ✅ Check legend shows "DeepNorth: 31.7%"
5. ✅ Verify no "Unknown_512" appears

## Files Modified
- `backend/VWE_WorldDataAPI/app/services/world_loader.py`
  - Added `Biome` import
  - Updated `_get_biome_name()` to use enum values instead of hardcoded integers

## Lesson Learned
**Always search for hardcoded constants across the entire codebase** when fixing data contract issues. In this case, the biome IDs were defined in TWO places:
1. The model (enum definition)
2. The service (hardcoded dictionary)

Both needed correction to ensure consistency.
