# Archive - Deprecated ETL Approaches

This directory contains deprecated or superseded ETL pipeline approaches that are no longer actively developed but preserved for reference.

## Contents

- **Legacy approaches** that have been replaced by better solutions
- **Experimental failures** that didn't work but provide valuable lessons
- **Outdated implementations** that are incompatible with current VWE standards

## Guidelines

- **DO NOT** use these approaches for new development
- **DO** reference them for historical context and lessons learned
- **DO** document why they were deprecated
- **DO NOT** modify without explicit approval

## Moving to Archive

When deprecating an approach:
1. Move the entire directory here
2. Add a `DEPRECATED.md` file explaining why it was deprecated
3. Update any references in the main codebase
4. Add migration notes if applicable
