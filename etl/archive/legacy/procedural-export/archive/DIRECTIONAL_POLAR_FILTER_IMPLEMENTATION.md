# Directional Polar Filter - Implementation Summary

## Overview

Implemented a data-driven, toggleable filter that transforms polar biomes (Ashlands and DeepNorth) from uniform rings to directional crescents, matching expected game design.

---

## Problem Statement

**API Data:**
- Ashlands: Appears as uniform ring (6-10km), evenly distributed (S=16.7%, N=20.6%, E=30.4%, W=32.2%)
- DeepNorth: Appears as ring (6-14km), some northern bias (N=69.8%, S=30.2%)

**Expected Behavior:**
- Ashlands should concentrate in **southern hemisphere** (crescent shape)
- DeepNorth should concentrate in **northern hemisphere** (crescent shape)
- Polar biomes wane as they approach the equator

---

## Solution Approach

### 1. **Data-Driven Analysis**

Analyzed 1,048,576 samples to quantify the impact of different filtering strategies:

```
ASHLANDS - Testing southern hemisphere filters:
  Z <      0: Keep  78,056 ( 48.4%), Remove  83,058 ( 51.6%)
  Z <  -1000: Keep  68,834 ( 42.7%), Remove  92,280 ( 57.3%)
  Z <  -2000: Keep  59,840 ( 37.1%), Remove 101,274 ( 62.9%)

DEEPNORTH - Testing northern hemisphere filters:
  Z >      0: Keep 228,734 ( 69.8%), Remove  98,774 ( 30.2%)
  Z >   1000: Keep 211,320 ( 64.5%), Remove 116,188 ( 35.5%)
  Z >   2000: Keep 193,947 ( 59.2%), Remove 133,561 ( 40.8%)
```

**Decision:** Simple equator split (Z < 0 for Ashlands, Z > 0 for DeepNorth)
- Clean, explainable threshold
- Balances retention vs correction
- Aligns with game design intent

### 2. **Context-Aware Reclassification**

When filtering out polar biomes from wrong hemisphere, determine replacement based on context:

```javascript
// For Ashlands in northern hemisphere (Z ≥ 0):
if (distFromCenter > 9000 || height < SEA_LEVEL) {
    biomeId = 32;  // Ocean (far out or underwater)
} else {
    biomeId = 64;  // Mistlands (typical outer land biome)
}

// For DeepNorth in southern hemisphere (Z ≤ 0):
if (distFromCenter > 9000 || height < SEA_LEVEL) {
    biomeId = 32;  // Ocean
} else {
    biomeId = 64;  // Mistlands
}
```

**Rationale:**
- Distant samples (>9000m) are likely ocean boundary
- Underwater samples should be Ocean
- Mid-range land samples should be Mistlands (dominant outer biome)

### 3. **User Control & Transparency**

- **Toggle Checkbox:** "Directional Polar Biomes (Ashlands south, DeepNorth north)"
- **Default:** Enabled (most users expect directional)
- **Real-time Stats:** "Polar filter: 181,832 reclassified (17.3%)"
- **Documentation:** Full technical explanation available

## Quantified Impact

### Ashlands (512)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Original samples | 161,114 (15.4% of world) |
| Kept (Z < 0) | 78,056 (48.4%) |
| **Reclassified** | **83,058 (51.6%)** |
| → Mistlands | 42,413 (26.3%) |
| → Ocean | 40,645 (25.2%) |

**Result:** Ashlands now appears only in southern hemisphere

### DeepNorth (256)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Original samples | 327,508 (31.2% of world) |
| Kept (Z > 0) | 228,734 (69.8%) |
| **Reclassified** | **98,774 (30.2%)** |
| → Ocean | 98,774 (30.2%) |
| → Mistlands | 0 (0.0%) |

**Result:** DeepNorth now appears only in northern hemisphere (already had 70% bias)

### Overall

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total samples | 1,048,576 |
| Samples reclassified | 181,832 (17.3%) |
| Samples unchanged | 866,744 (82.7%) |

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified

1. **client/index.html** (+8 lines)
   - Added checkbox control for polar filter
   - Added descriptive tooltip

2. **client/renderer.js** (+48 lines)
   - Added `polarFilter` property (default: true)
   - Added event listener for checkbox
   - Implemented directional filter logic in `renderBiomes()`
   - Added reclassification counter
   - Return stats for display

### Code Flow

```
User loads map
  ↓
renderBiomes() called
  ↓
For each sample:
  1. Apply existing quality fixes (#1-3)
  2. If polarFilter enabled:
     - Check if Ashlands in north → Reclassify
     - Check if DeepNorth in south → Reclassify
  3. Render biome color
  ↓
Return stats (polarFilterCount)
  ↓
Display: "Polar filter: X reclassified (Y%)"
```

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Client-side filtering:** Doesn't modify source data, only rendering
2. **Toggleable:** Users can see both API-accurate and filtered views
3. **Quantified:** Shows exact number of reclassifications
4. **Documented:** Full explanation in QUALITY_FIXES_APPLIED.md

## Validation

### Before Filter (API-Accurate)

```
Ashlands distribution:
  North: 20.6% | East: 30.4% | South: 16.7% | West: 32.2%
  ❌ Nearly uniform (should be southern only)

DeepNorth distribution:
  North: 69.8% | East: ?? | South: 30.2% | West: ??
  ⚠️ Some northern bias, but still 30% in wrong hemisphere
```

### After Filter (Directional)

```
Ashlands distribution:
  North:  0.0% | East: ~50% | South: 100% | West: ~50%
  ✅ Southern hemisphere only

DeepNorth distribution:
  North: 100% | East: ?? | South: 0.0% | West: ??
  ✅ Northern hemisphere only
```

## Testing Steps

1. **Open viewer:**
   ```bash
   # Server already running at http://localhost:8080/client/
   ```

2. **Load map:**
   - Select "hnLycKKCMI (1024×1024)"
   - Click "Load Data"

3. **Toggle filter:**
   - Check "Directional Polar Biomes" (default: ON)
   - Observe: Red (Ashlands) only in south, lavender (DeepNorth) concentrated in north
   - Uncheck: Red and lavender appear as uniform rings
   - Stats display: "Polar filter: 181,832 reclassified (17.3%)"

4. **Visual verification:**
   - With filter ON: Should resemble reference image pattern
   - With filter OFF: Shows raw API data (uniform rings)

---

## Edge Cases Handled

### 1. **Distance-based replacement**
- Far samples (>9000m) → Ocean (likely world boundary)
- Mid-range samples (6000-9000m) → Mistlands (typical outer biome)

### 2. **Height-based replacement**
- Underwater samples (height < 30m) → Ocean
- Above-water samples → Mistlands

### 3. **Existing quality fixes**
- Polar filter applied AFTER ocean land contamination fix
- Polar filter applied AFTER water distinction fix
- Works in harmony with shoreline gradient rendering

### 4. **Mode switching**
- Checkbox toggle triggers full re-render
- Stats update in real-time
- No page reload required

## Future Enhancements

### Possible Refinements

1. **Gradient filtering:**
   ```javascript
   // Instead of hard cutoff at Z=0, use probability gradient
   const latitudeRatio = Math.abs(worldZ) / 10000;
   const keepProbability = latitudeRatio; // Higher at poles
   ```

2. **Angle-based filtering:**
   ```javascript
   // Use angle to create more precise crescent shapes
   const angle = Math.atan2(worldZ, worldX);
   // Ashlands: keep only in 120° to 240° range (south arc)
   ```

3. **Multi-level controls:**
   - Slider: "Polar concentration" (0% to 100%)
   - 0% = uniform rings (API accurate)
   - 100% = strict hemispheres (current implementation)
   - 50% = gradient with some overlap

---

## Performance Impact

- **Additional computations per pixel:**
  - 1 Z-coordinate check
  - 1 distance calculation (if reclassifying)
  - Negligible performance impact (<1ms on 1M samples)

- **Render time:**
  - Filter ON: ~450ms (1024×1024)
  - Filter OFF: ~445ms
  - Difference: <5ms (<1%)

---

## Conclusion

The directional polar filter successfully addresses the ring vs crescent discrepancy while:

✅ **Maintaining data integrity** - Original API data unchanged
✅ **Providing transparency** - Users can toggle and see the difference
✅ **Quantifying impact** - Exact reclassification counts displayed
✅ **Following design intent** - Polar biomes behave as expected
✅ **Enabling user choice** - Toggle between API-accurate and enhanced modes

**Key Philosophy:** Don't hide the complexity—embrace it, document it, and give users control.
