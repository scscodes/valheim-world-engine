# Directional Polar Filter - Implementation Complete âœ…

## Summary

Implemented a **toggleable directional filter** for polar biomes based on data-driven analysis. The filter transforms Ashlands and DeepNorth from uniform rings to hemisphere-specific crescents.

---

## What Changed

### 1. **New UI Control**

Added checkbox in the map viewer:
```
â˜‘ Directional Polar Biomes (Ashlands south, DeepNorth north)
```

**Default:** Enabled (checked)
**Effect:** Polar biomes appear in correct hemispheres

### 2. **Filter Logic**

**Simple equator split:**
- Ashlands (red): Keep only samples with Z < 0 (southern hemisphere)
- DeepNorth (lavender): Keep only samples with Z > 0 (northern hemisphere)

**Context-aware reclassification:**
- Northern Ashlands â†’ Mistlands or Ocean (based on distance/height)
- Southern DeepNorth â†’ Mistlands or Ocean (based on distance/height)

### 3. **Real-time Stats**

Viewer displays impact:
```
Rendered 1,048,576 samples in 450ms | Polar filter: 181,832 reclassified (17.3%)
```

## Data-Driven Justification

### Analysis Results

**Ashlands (512) - Original API Data:**
- Total: 161,114 samples (15.4% of world)
- Distribution: N=20.6%, E=30.4%, **S=16.7%**, W=32.2%
- **Problem:** Nearly uniform (should be southern only)

**After Filter:**
- Kept (Z < 0): 78,056 samples (48.4%)
- Removed (Z â‰¥ 0): 83,058 samples (51.6%)
  - â†’ Mistlands: 42,413
  - â†’ Ocean: 40,645
- **Result:** 100% in southern hemisphere âœ…

**DeepNorth (256) - Original API Data:**
- Total: 327,508 samples (31.2% of world)
- Distribution: **N=69.8%**, S=30.2%
- **Problem:** Already has northern bias, but 30% in wrong hemisphere

**After Filter:**
- Kept (Z > 0): 228,734 samples (69.8%)
- Removed (Z â‰¤ 0): 98,774 samples (30.2%)
  - â†’ Ocean: 98,774
- **Result:** 100% in northern hemisphere âœ…

### Overall Impact

- **Total samples:** 1,048,576
- **Reclassified:** 181,832 (17.3%)
- **Unchanged:** 866,744 (82.7%)

## How to Use

### View the Map

1. **Open browser:**
   ```
   http://localhost:8080/client/
   ```

2. **Load world:**
   - Select: "hnLycKKCMI (1024Ã—1024)"
   - Click: "Load Data"

3. **Toggle filter:**
   - **ON (checked):** Directional polar biomes (Ashlands south, DeepNorth north)
   - **OFF (unchecked):** API-accurate rings

4. **Compare:**
   - Toggle the checkbox and watch the red (Ashlands) and lavender (DeepNorth) regions change
   - Stats update showing how many samples were reclassified

### Visual Comparison

**Filter ON (Default):**
- Ashlands (red): Crescent in south (bottom of map)
- DeepNorth (lavender): Concentrated in north (top of map)
- Mistlands (dark gray): More visible on east/west edges

**Filter OFF:**
- Ashlands (red): Uniform ring around map
- DeepNorth (lavender): Larger ring, slight northern bias
- Appears as concentric circles rather than directional

## Technical Details

### Implementation

**Files modified:**
- `client/renderer.js` - Filter logic (+48 lines)
- `client/index.html` - UI checkbox (+8 lines)

**Approach:**
- Client-side rendering filter (doesn't modify source data)
- Applied after existing quality fixes (#1-3)
- Transparent and reversible

**Performance:**
- Render time impact: <5ms (<1% overhead)
- Toggle is instant (triggers re-render)

### Quality Fixes Applied

The map now includes **4 quality fixes:**

1. **Ocean land contamination** - Fixed 18,985 samples above sea level
2. **Edge biome water distinction** - Ocean vs land in polar regions
3. **Shoreline gradient rendering** - Smooth water transitions
4. **Directional polar filtering** - Hemisphere-specific biomes (NEW)

## Key Achievements

âœ… **Data integrity preserved** - Original API data unchanged in source files
âœ… **User control** - Toggle between API-accurate and enhanced modes
âœ… **Full transparency** - All transformations documented and quantified
âœ… **Performance maintained** - <1% rendering overhead
âœ… **Reversible** - Can disable filter at any time

---

## Philosophy

Rather than treating the reference images as absolute truth, we:

1. **Analyzed the actual API data** - 1M+ samples
2. **Quantified the discrepancy** - Ring vs directional
3. **Implemented logical correction** - Equator split for polar biomes
4. **Provided transparency** - User can see both modes
5. **Documented thoroughly** - Full technical trail

**Result:** A map viewer that balances API accuracy with expected game design, giving users choice and understanding.

## Next Steps (Optional)

### Possible Enhancements

1. **Gradient filtering:**
   - Instead of hard equator split, use probability gradient
   - Polar concentration fades toward equator

2. **Angle-based filtering:**
   - More precise crescent shapes (120Â° arcs instead of hemispheres)
   - Matches reference image patterns more closely

3. **User-adjustable threshold:**
   - Slider for polar concentration (0-100%)
   - 0% = uniform rings, 100% = strict hemispheres

4. **In-game validation:**
   - Load seed in actual Valheim
   - Teleport to key positions
   - Verify `/biome` command output

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Filter ON: Ashlands appears only in south
- [x] Filter OFF: Ashlands appears as ring
- [x] Toggle updates instantly
- [x] Stats display reclassification count
- [x] Performance acceptable (<1% overhead)

## Conclusion

The directional polar filter is **complete and ready to use**. The map viewer now provides:

- **API-accurate mode** (filter OFF) - Shows exactly what WorldGenerator.GetBiome() returns
- **Enhanced mode** (filter ON, default) - Directional polar biomes matching game design

Both modes are valid, documented, and accessible to users. The choice reflects the project's commitment to transparency and data-driven decision making.
