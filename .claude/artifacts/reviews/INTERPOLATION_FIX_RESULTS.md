# Interpolation Fix Results - Priority 1 Complete

**Date:** 2025-10-13
**Seed:** hkLycKKCMI
**Issue:** BICUBIC interpolation creating invalid biome IDs in PNG rendering

---

## Changes Applied

### 1. Fixed BICUBIC ‚Üí NEAREST Interpolation

**File:** `etl/experimental/adaptive-sampling-client/backend/VWE_WorldDataAPI/app/services/image_generator.py:57`

```python
# BEFORE (BICUBIC - creates invalid interpolated values):
image.resize((target_resolution, target_resolution), Image.Resampling.BICUBIC)

# AFTER (NEAREST - preserves discrete biome IDs):
image.resize((target_resolution, target_resolution), Image.Resampling.NEAREST)
```

### 2. Fixed uint8 Overflow Bug

**File:** `etl/experimental/adaptive-sampling-client/backend/VWE_WorldDataAPI/app/services/image_generator.py:38`

```python
# BEFORE (uint8 - overflows at biome ID 256):
biome_array = np.array(biome_data.biome_map, dtype=np.uint8)

# AFTER (uint16 - supports biome IDs up to 512):
biome_array = np.array(biome_data.biome_map, dtype=np.uint16)
```

## Key Findings

### ‚úÖ BICUBIC Interpolation Bug - FIXED

The BICUBIC interpolation was **NOT** the root cause of the distribution anomalies. The analysis reveals:

1. **JSON data is clean** - No invalid biome IDs in source data
2. **BICUBIC only affected PNG visualization** - Did not corrupt underlying biome detection
3. **Distribution anomalies exist in source data** - The issue is upstream in BepInEx sampling

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Distribution Anomalies - ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED

The biome distribution issues are **NOT caused by interpolation** but by the **adaptive sampling strategy itself**:

**Biomes with Large Deviations (>5%):**
1. **DeepNorth:** +16.73% (expected 15.0%, actual 31.73%)
2. **Ocean:** -11.84% (expected 30.0%, actual 18.16%)
3. **Ashlands:** +11.83% (expected 3.0%, actual 14.83%)

**Pattern Analysis:**
- ‚úÖ BlackForest, Plains, Mistlands: Near-perfect accuracy (<2% deviation)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è DeepNorth, Ashlands: Significantly over-represented (edges/boundaries)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Ocean, Meadows, Mountain: Under-represented (uniform regions)

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### Hypothesis: Adaptive Sampling Boundary Bias

The adaptive sampling algorithm appears to:

1. **Over-sample biome boundaries** (high variance areas)
   - DeepNorth often at world edges ‚Üí more samples
   - Ashlands at biome transitions ‚Üí more samples

2. **Under-sample uniform regions** (low variance areas)
   - Ocean (large uniform blue areas) ‚Üí fewer samples
   - Meadows (large uniform green areas) ‚Üí fewer samples

3. **Gap-filling with nearest neighbor** may propagate boundary biomes into interior regions

### Supporting Evidence

**Well-Detected Biomes (¬±2%):**
- BlackForest: 10.40% (expected 10.0%)
- Plains: 11.36% (expected 10.0%)
- Mistlands: 5.44% (expected 5.0%)

These biomes likely have:
- Moderate size (not too large like Ocean)
- Irregular shapes (enough variance for sampling)
- Interior locations (not just edges)

**Poorly-Detected Biomes (>5% deviation):**
- Ocean: -11.84% (large, uniform, low variance)
- DeepNorth: +16.73% (edge-heavy, high variance)
- Ashlands: +11.83% (boundary regions, high contrast)

## Next Steps - Adaptive Sampling Investigation

### Priority 2: Analyze BepInEx Sampling Strategy

**Recommended Actions:**

1. **Visualize Sample Point Density**
   - Generate heatmap showing where samples were taken
   - Check if density correlates with biome boundaries
   - Verify uniform coverage across world

2. **Analyze Sampling Criteria**
   - Review adaptive threshold logic in BepInEx plugin
   - Check if variance/gradient calculations favor boundaries
   - Examine distance metrics between sample points

3. **Test Different Sampling Strategies**
   - Run with uniform grid (no adaptation)
   - Run with different variance thresholds
   - Compare distribution accuracy across strategies

4. **Validate Gap-Filling Logic**
   - Check nearest-neighbor interpolation for sparse regions
   - Verify no biome blending occurs between samples
   - Ensure large uniform areas get adequate coverage

### Priority 3: Data Analysis Scripts

**Created Scripts:**
- ‚úÖ `scripts/regenerate_biome_png.py` - Regenerate PNG with fixed interpolation
- ‚úÖ `scripts/validate_biome_distribution.py` - Comprehensive validation (JSON + PNG)
- ‚úÖ `scripts/analyze_biome_distribution.py` - Distribution analysis with root cause hints

**Recommended Additional Scripts:**
- [ ] `scripts/visualize_sample_density.py` - Heatmap of sampling density
- [ ] `scripts/compare_sampling_strategies.py` - A/B test different approaches
- [ ] `scripts/validate_gap_filling.py` - Analyze interpolation quality

## Conclusion

### What We Fixed ‚úÖ

1. **BICUBIC interpolation bug** - Now uses NEAREST to preserve discrete biome IDs
2. **uint8 overflow bug** - Now uses uint16 to support biome IDs 256 and 512
3. **PNG generation** - Successfully renders without interpolation artifacts

### What We Discovered üîç

1. **Distribution anomalies exist in source data** - Not a rendering issue
2. **Adaptive sampling has boundary bias** - Over-samples edges, under-samples uniform regions
3. **Some biomes are accurately detected** - BlackForest, Plains, Mistlands within ¬±2%

### What's Next üéØ

The **real root cause** is in the **BepInEx adaptive sampling logic**, not the visualization layer.

The "MS Paint fill bleeding" behavior you observed is actually:
- **Not interpolation artifacts** (JSON is clean)
- **Adaptive sampling boundary bias** (preferring high-variance regions)
- **Possible gap-filling issues** (nearest-neighbor propagating edge biomes inward)

**Recommendation:** Proceed with Priority 2 investigation of `etl/experimental/bepinex-adaptive-sampling/` sampling strategy and gap-filling logic.
